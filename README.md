The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word 
- [X] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word

## Notes

This app was fun to build and required more coding than the previous apps. It took some time to get the layout right but apart from that, there were no difficulties.
